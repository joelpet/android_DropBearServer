This is a SSH server, based on DropBear.
It allows you to easily install, configure and run a Secured SHell on your Android phone.
SSH is a secured (encrypted) protocol that is used on millions of GNU/Linux servers to issue commands remotely.

THIS REQUIRES ROOT PERMISSIONS
If you don't know what 'root' or 'ssh' means, you probably don't need this!

* You will be able to gain shell access, just like 'adb shell'
* You will be able to pull files via 'scp' or similar

This rich front-end to DropBear allows you to easily configure tons of things:

* Allows root access (optional)
* Allows non-root access (sdcard read/write)
* Install DropBear
* Start/Stop the server
* Manage credentials (publickeys or master password)
* Loads public keys from SDCard
* and much more!

Highly configurable!

GNU/Linux:
* Terminal: ssh
* Terminal: scp

Windows:
* PuTTY/KiTTY
* WinSCP

MacOS:
* Terminal: ssh
* Terminal: scp
* Cyberduck

Next to come
* Working SSH/SCP from phone

Now you will have full control of your device!
