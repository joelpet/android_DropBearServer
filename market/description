[Overview]

This is a SSH server, based on DropBear.
It allows you to easily install, configure and run a Secured SHell on your Android phone.
SSH is a secured (encrypted) protocol that is used on millions of GNU/Linux servers to issue commands remotely.

[Attention]

THIS REQUIRES ROOT PERMISSIONS If you don't know what 'root', 'ssh' or 'public key' means, you probably don't need this! This is an Open-Source software released under the GNU GPLv2+. [Features]
Review its code at GitHub: https://github.com/shkschneider/android_DropBearServer

[Features]
* You will be able to gain shell access, just like 'adb shell'
* You will be able to pull files via 'scp' or similar

This rich front-end to DropBear allows you to easily configure tons of things:

* Allows root access (optional)
* Allows non-root access (sdcard read/write)
* Install DropBear
* Start/Stop the server
* Manage credentials (publickeys or master password)
* Loads public keys from SDCard

Now you will have full control of your device!

[Will It Conflict With Other Binaries]

Up to version 1.7, it might.
From 1.8 and up, it won't :)
